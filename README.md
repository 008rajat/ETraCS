# ETraCS

ETraCS is short for Emergency Traffic Corridor system. ETraCS aims to generalize the concept of [Green Corridors]:(https://www.donatelife.org.in/green-corridor-system) to all types of emergency services, by automating the process of creation of emergency corridors.

As a part of the project we developed a minimal prototype to automate the creation of emergency corridors. The city was simulated as a 9 node matrix with four 3-directional signals at 4 nodes and one 4-directional signal at the central node. 

Aurduino UNO was used as the controller and DTMF module was used to communicate the passage of ambulance via phone to the controller.
